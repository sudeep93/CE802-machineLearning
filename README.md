Jupyter Notebook
The task of this project is to explore the feasibility of using Machine Learning
to forecast whether a customer will file a claim on their travel and to predict
the value of the claim. I did data Pre-processing, built model using dierent
Machine Learning algorithms like KNN, Random Forest, XG-boost and Deep
Neural Networks.
